						At this time you don't need to worry about accessibiltiy or cross compatibility, so using contenteditable in a div/span is an OK hack

						If this was released to the world, you would want to implement browser input behaviour, tabs, screen reader stuff.

						Simply, when you get to a new line, the style of auto hieght grows with the text.

						When you submit, you want to pickup the contents of the span using 
						document.getElementById('reaction-text').innerText

						innerText property is non standard, and will not work cross browser, but it is fine for your needs.

						It would be prefable to use innerHTML instead - but you would have to parse the line breaks and divs - this isn't a big deal but 

						document.getElementById('reaction-text').innerHTML
